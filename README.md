This is the page for interactive graph assignment. In this assignment, a Shiny app is built with four tabs: the Introduction and three interactive graphs. The inline writeups explains why did I choose this topic (what is the story), why did I select these graphical forms  and how does interacitivity enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?


Unfortuantely the app cannot be published through my machine due to some technical issue. (`Error in force(code) : Could not upload file. Calls: <Anonymous> -> withStatus -> force` - please let me know if you have a solution to this issue) Thus the app and the data need to be downloaded to deploy. 


**Since the dataset is too large, I put all my work at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QFObsmQzXgArtyK8tqnfJMOb7WS9GiRu?usp=sharing**
