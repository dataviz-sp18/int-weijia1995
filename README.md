This is the page for interactive graph assignment. In this assignment, a Shiny app is built with four tabs: the Introduction and three interactive graphs. The inline writeups explains why did I choose this topic (what is the story), why did I select these graphical forms  and how does interacitivity enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?


Unfortuantely the app cannot be published through my machine due to some technical issue. (the hexbin package is missing and cannot be installed for some reason.) Thus the code and the data need to be downloaded to run.
